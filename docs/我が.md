`我が/わが` means `I` or `we` and it can be put next to a noun to denote possession of it. So we can say `わが家`, which means `my house` or `our house`.

わが[[まま]] means `my unchanged condition`, but this clearly is influenced by expressions like `思いのまま` or `心のまま`. So this `わがまま` means `my unchanged condition` implying `my will`, `wanting the world to go in accordance with my will,` wanting the world to be `思いのまま`, `心のまま`.
